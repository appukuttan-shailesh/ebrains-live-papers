                Where to find underlying data?
              </div>
              <div className="block-text">
                Consider that you came across a scientfic publication that
                piqued your interest. It might be because:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    the experimental data produced by the authors could aid your
                    own scientific work, or
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    the model developed by them could be used by you to test
                    certain other hypotheses, or
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    you simply wish to reproduce the findings reported in the
                    article
                  </li>
                </ul>
                To do any of these, you need access to the underlying data. And
                this is where things can get difficult. Very often authors
                simply resort to adding a statement in their publication,
                something similar to:
                <div
                  style={{
                    backgroundColor: "#DCEDC8",
                    textAlign: "center",
                    padding: "10px",
                    marginLeft: "10%",
                    marginRight: "10%",
                    marginTop: "20px",
                    marginBottom: "20px",
                  }}
                >
                  <span
                    style={{
                      fontFamily: "cursive",
                      fontWeight: "bold",
                      fontStyle: "italic",
                    }}
                  >
                    "Data are available from the authors upon request."
                  </span>
                </div>
                This typically results in a situation where potential users face
                a dead-end because authors are either unresponsive, have left
                academia, or because code or data have been lost, or are
                otherwise no longer available.
                <br />
                <br />
                What is lacking is a structured and systematic way of offering
                these resources, that makes this process simpler for both the
                authors and the potential users.

                Interactivity is a prominent feature with several integrated
                tools and services that will allow users to download, visualise

                scientific study into a systematic, structured and distributable
                format. The live paper builder tool has been developed with the
                primary focus on making this data sharing process as simple as
                possible.

                With data being managed via the EBRAINS KG, the issue of data
                provenance can also be better tackled, along with tighter
                integration with other tools and services offered under the
                EBRAINS ecosystem.

                Authors of scientific publications are encouraged to create live

                Live papers can be set to be password-protected, thereby
                enabling them to be shared solely with reviewers prior to
                publication, or be made public and thereby freely accessible to
                the scientific community.

                We present here an online platform for sharing resources
                underlying publications in neuroscience. It enables authors to
                easily upload and distribute digital resources, such as data,
                code, and notebooks, in a structured and systematic way.
                Interactivity is a prominent feature of the Live Papers, with
                features to download, visualise or simulate data, models and
                results presented in the corresponding publications. The
                resources are hosted on reliable data storage servers to ensure
                long term availability and easy accessibility. All data are
                managed via the EBRAINS Knowledge Graph, thereby helping
                maintain data provenance, and enabling tight integration with
                tools and services offered under the EBRAINS ecosystem.
